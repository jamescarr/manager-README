## Feedback
I believe that a tight feedback loop is a crucial component to building trust and respect on a team. 

Also recognize that disagreement is a form of feedback and the sooner we can open and honestly disagree with each other the better we'll be. :-)

## One-on-Ones

We'll have regular 1:1s for us to give feedback to each other and work progressively on goals. I'll never cancel a 1:1 unless one of us are out of office for the week, however I may reschedule our 1:1 if there are unforeseen difficulties with our set time. When I solicit feedback I really enjoy it to be blunt and too the point and when I give feedback I will always give honest and critical feedback without fluffing it up. I'll never stop asking for feedback on my performance, the team or our processes.

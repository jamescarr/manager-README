# Hi, I'm James!
I'm so glad you've decided to join us at $COMPANY and our team!

This document is my attempt to be transparent and clearly lay out what you can expect from me and how I work. You can consider this kind of an API documentation to how I operate.


## Feedback
I believe that a tight feedback loop is a crucial component to building trust and respect on a team. 

I prefer feedback that is given to me to be to the point. Sometimes people tell me they feel like they're giving me a hard time when they're giving me difficult feedback but that's not true... I recognize critical feedback for what it is and prefer for it not to be softened up. When I give feedback I will be clear on intent however I will ask you how you prefer feedback and custom tailor my message to fit your needs.

To me the primary focus of feedback is to enable people to be the best version of themselves and help them grow. Also recognize that disagreement is a form of feedback and the sooner we can open and honestly disagree with each other the better we'll be. :-)

## Meetings

### One-on-Ones

We'll have regular 1:1s for us to give feedback to each other and work progressively on goals. I'll never cancel a 1:1 unless one of us are out of office for the week, however I may reschedule our 1:1 if there are unforeseen difficulties with our set time. If we're geographically co-located we'll chat face-to-face (usually on a walk) while we'll do a video call otherwise.

I'll share an agenda of bullet points of things I want to cover before we meet and aim to have give no surprises. However my talking points are secondary to what you want to discuss. I'll let you go first and really give you as much time as you need to get what you want to talk about off of your chest. I do all of my one-on-ones on the same day but leave a good amount of space between them in case we go over. 

$COMPANY has a standard review cycle twice a year. At this point we'll review your progress and form goals for the next review. These reviews should contain nothing that is a surprise as it should be the same content that we have been discussing in our regular 1:1s. 

### Team Meetings

Outside of our 1:1s, we'll have a few team meetings. We have a regular team hangout once a week which typically lasts 30 minutes and is a good time for us to reflect on the week, come up with some action items or address any team-spanning issues. We also have a planning game once a week to go over work completed, in progress and upcoming. Finally, there may be a couple organizational meetings that may or may not be optional.

## My Personal Principles

<blockquote>
“With perfect and unyielding faith, <br>
With steadfastness, respect, and courtesy, <br>
With modesty and conscientiousness, <br>
Work calmly for the happiness of others.”

## How to Interpret My Calendar 
My calendar can typically be pretty jam packed with meetings. However if it isn't an interview, 1:1 or vendor meeting I can likely move something if you need to chat face-to-face. Ping me regardless... a vendor meeting on my calendar may actually be optional.

## Nuances
* __I am hearing impaired__. I've been hard of hearing my whole life and this can surface in bizarre ways. I might start talking too loudly. I read lips. I often mishear what people say. You can help out by making sure your lips are visible while we speak and double checking if my answer to your question feels "off". Also please feel free to DM me if you feel like my tone got a bit loud! :-) 

* __I can be easily distracted__. If it feels like my attention is elsewhere during a meeting, please speak up. I really try to avoid doing this, but it happens.

* __I am big on work/life balance__. Most people will work between 8am (the earliest) and 6pm (the latest). Since we're a 100% remote team distributed across the globe there will always be people online in slack doing something. I recommend sharing your "core hours" and I won't expect to communicate with you outside these hours unless it is an emergency. I try not to respond to e-mails or slack during my off-hours and **under no circumstances expect you to, unless it’s an emergency*****.
